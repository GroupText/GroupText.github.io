And zero acres for the Muckleshoot. A month later, at the Point Elliott treaty council, zero land was reserved for Muckleshoot. ""

He succeeded in bringing about the expansion of the Nisqually and Puyallup Reservations to a level that would allow our survival. His efforts resulted in the establishment of the Muckleshoot Reservation, when there had been no land set aside for Muckleshoot under either treaty.
<br><br>
“Leschi was as good a friend as we ever had. He was dignified in his intercourse and proud of his country, and, I may say, proud of himself. He had a benevolent countenance that unmistakably stamped him as a good man. Leschi told me before going to the war that the Indians would not hurt any of the settlers, and advised us to stay on our farms, which we did. I never was afraid to go wherever I wanted to during the war and did as I wished.""

Connell’s Prairie",https://www.youtube.com/embed/iutoP2TNMc4,,https://youtu.be/iutoP2TNMc4,"Connell and McAllister killed while illegally pursuing Leschi’s people.
<br><br>
""James McAllister was one of those “weak and needy” settlers who had been squatting for over ten years on Nisqually land. He wrote a letter to the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Washington Territory claiming: 
'From the most reliable Indians that we have in this country, we have information and are satisfied that Leschi, a sub-chief and half Clickitat is and has been doing all that he could possibly do to unite the Indians of this country to raise against the Whites in a hostile manner and has had some join in with him already. Sir, I am of the opinion that he should be attended to as soon as convenient for fear that he might do something bad. Let his arrangements be stopped at once. Your attention to the above will be exceedingly appreciated by the people of Nisqually bottoms.' (McAllister, 1855)
<br><br>
""Acting Governor Mason responded to McAllister’s letter by authorizing a militia to be called Eaton’s Rangers. 
'Should you meet any unusual or suspicious assemblage of Indians, you will disarm them, and should they resist, disperse them, and put any who resist or use violence to death, or send them to Fort Steilacoom in irons, or bound as you may deem best.' (Mason 1855)
<br><br>
McAllister joined the rangers who promptly commenced the first military act of war. On October 24, 1855, armed with orders to kill resisters. They charged out to Chief Leschi’s home at Muck Creek to arrest Leschi and his brother Quiemuth. McAllister and Connell continued the pursuit from Muck Creek to one of Muckleshoot’s agriculturally rich prairies, Connell had been squatting on and had destroying the wild blueberry crop. On October 27, Tu-wa-pa-ti, took out McAllister, and also killed Connell.""

Battle along the Green River",,,,"""Muckleshoot warriors addressed personal wrongs with the new settlers who had pushed them out of their main village, helped themselves to their food, ripped up their crops and abused the Indian people. 100% of our Muckleshoot land had been taken from them under the treaty and none had been reserved at this point in time yet. The Muckleshoot warriors had no choice but to fight.
<br><br>
An aggressive squatter named William Brannan, who was said to have an aggressive temperament making him a poor excuse for a neighbor, had the audacity to stake his “claim” adjacent and downriver from our main town of Ilalqo. That put him in a position to be able cork off our salmon run. Chief Nelson personally warned him to leave the day before, but he was too arrogant or too stupid to heed the warning.""

Not far from here is the place that Thunder became the protector of the Puyallup people in war.
<br><br>
By itself, the death of these militia men was not a remarkable event, as we were now in full war. But Stevens later used the death of Moses as a tool for his personal vendetta against our good chiefs. Chief Leschi and Quiemuth were later indicted for killing this man who had taken up arms against  the Indians. Quiemuth was then murdered while in custody. Chief Leschi was lynched after his second “trial” that was based on perjured testimony. 
Leschi and Quiemuth did not kill either man. They never betrayed those who did. No one was ever tried for the murders of our warriors or the murders of our women, children and old ones.""

The Indians...began to push up hats and sticks...and bang, bang, bang would go the guns of the enemy, down would go the hat and another Indian reported killed.

Bittings Prairie",,,,"""The fog was called in, a power that we know was carried by Wahelut. Soldiers camped near sqʷəspł village were relieved of 40 horses - compensation for the horses stolen last month from Leschi's herd.  At least one non-native historian say that Kitsap, Kanasket, Nelson, and Quiemuth made life miserable for Slaughter and his people on ""Bittings Prairie"" for a couple of days. Bitting was one of the early trespassers into the Puyallup Tribe's country. The village there was home to Kitsap's younger brother quoyəpqəd (Tommy Lane, who has many descendants at Puyallup.
<br><br>
The account by H.H. Bancroft: ""Upon the march, which began on the 24th of November, Slaughter was attacked at night at Biddings prairie, one mile from the Puyallup, and sustained a loss of forty horses during a heavy fog which concealed the movements of the Indians. On the morning of the 26th E. G. Price of Wallace's company, while attending to camp duty, was shot and killed by a lurking foe. The chiefs who commanded in the attack on the night of the 25th were Kitsap and Kanascut of the Klikitats, Quiemuth and Klowowit of the Nisquallies, and Nelson of the Green River and Niscope Indians. During two nights that the troops were encamped on this prairie the Indians continually harassed them by their yells, and by crawling up out of the woods which surrounded the little plain, and under cover of the fog coming close enough to fire into camp in spite of the sentries, who discharged their pieces into the surrounding gloom without effect.""",10,,47.16871,-122.20796,,,,,,

We thought we had made it rather clear on October 28, that trespassers were not welcome, but the soldiers returned to the same site, with the same result. A traitor was traveling with the soldiers as “a guide”. That evening, Lt. Slaughter foolishly allowed himself to be illuminated by their cooking fire. The traitor/guide warned Slaughter that we were present and then he had the good sense to duck. Lt. Slaughter refused to believe him and our sharpshooters,  Sasticum and Paul Weyallup took out Slaughter. 
<br><br>
Our sharpshooters were powerful and honorable men. They were later allotted choice land on the Puyallup reservation, lived long lives and left successful families. We will honor them and all of our warriors to express our gratitude for their bravery that resulted in the return of our land.""

Fox Island",,,,"""During the first treaty war, many of the Indian people were held in concentration camps. One camp was at Fox Island, across what is now the Narrows Bridge near Tacoma. The Duwamish were held a concentration camp at Port Blakely on Bainbridge Island. 
<br><br>
Chief Leschi visited the concentration camp on Fox Island. Cecelia Carpenter described it a peace mission but Leschi’s mere presence set off the opposite effect. Mrs. Carpenter wrote, “When the message arrived at Steilacoom [sent by Agent John Swan] that Leschi had landed on the island [it] sent the citizenry and the army into a panic unlike any other event of the war.” The whites were terrified of the consequences, that were sure to result, from their own bad behavior. 
<br><br>
The Muckleshoots, Upper Puyallups, Nisquallies and our allies stood our ground and refused to go to the camps. To paraphrase my relative Gerald Moses Jr., we did what we do best; we fought for what’s ours.""",10,,47.26,-122.6124,,,,,,
"Mid January 1856  
Aid from the Easter Indian Warriors",,,,"""A worn and weary Indian arrived at Ow-hi’s village, having crossed the Cascades on snowshoes. He bore a message from Chief Leschi asking that a band of warriors be sent him to aid in his contemplated attack upon Seattle. Leschi was closely related to the Yakimas, his mother having been a daughter of Chief We-ow-wicht. He and Qualchan, therefore, were cousins. (A.J. Splawn from his book, Ka-mi-akin, The Last Hero of the Yakimas.)
<br><br>
At the council which Ow-hi called, Qualchan offered to lead some braves over the mountains. About one hundred men were ready to go and they were soon on their way. When they got as far as Ka-sit-kees (Easton), their horses had to be sent back on account of the deep snow. The warriors, proceeding on snowshoes, reached Leschi’s camp the fourth day out. Here they found about 300 warriors under the leadership of Leschi and Coquilton near Lake Washington, awaiting the arrival of their Yakima relatives before making the attack.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Kanasket's power told him that he was going to die that day. He was not afraid of death but the soldiers were terrified of him. Afterward, they wrote gruesome descriptions of the strength of his body and of his hatred for the whites, who had caused the Indian People so much needless suffering. ""

Kautz were on good terms with each other and there were no hard feelings over the shooting. A.V. Kautz later did his best to prove that Leschi was innocent of the crime for which he was eventually hung.
<br><br>
Our People must never again forget to honor our relatives from east of the mountains for the sacrifice they made in our time of need and while they were still engaged in their own war. It was the second time that Qualchan and warriors answered our call.
'[W]hen about the first of March, 1856, an Indian runner from Puget Sound came to Ow-hi's village on the Wenas with word from Leschi that the soldiers were pressing his people so hard that they had time neither to rest nor sleep, Qual-chan and E-ne-as set out at once with fifty braves via the Nah-cheez pass. …they found Leschi, Stehi and  Qui-em-uth with about 300 warriors, skirmishing with Col. Casey's command.' A.J. Splawn

The two forces were about equal, the fight, which raged all day, resulting in a drawn battle. The Indians had seven killed and about twenty wounded.  At a council held that night, Qual-chan expressed the opinion that further fighting would be useless. ""Today's fight has convinced me, ""he said, ""that you cannot cope with the whites. I noticed reinforcements constantly arriving in the camp of the enemy, and these will continue, whereas you have the greater portion of your fighting men now on the ground. I advise you to move all your people at once to the Yakima valley. 
It was decided to act upon this advice and the retreat began at once. These people had made their brave fight; their last stand for their homes against a fate too strong for them. Worn and weary they took their way, with what little food they had hastily gathered the morning after the battle, over the snow and across the icy streams. In that dreadful retreat over the winter mountains, many old men and women and little children perished by the wayside and were buried in the snow. The wails of the women and the crying of the children touched even the stout heart of Qual-chan.
